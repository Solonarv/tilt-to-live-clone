## Visual
Screenshake/hit-stop for explosions

Lighting for powerup effects?

Enemies, powerups spawn in funkily: appear at scale = 0, smoothly go up to scale = 1, only become collidable once scale > 0.5 or something, only start moving once finished scaling

Score counters animates / particle FX

## Auditory
SFX for all the powerups
