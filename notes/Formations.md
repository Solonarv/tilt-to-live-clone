## General
#TODO more types

## Types
### Spinning Cross
Five 5x5 blocks of dots arranged in a `+` shape. Spins around its center while moving at constant velocity.

play impact: just generic clutter to dodge. not difficult, but closes off paths for dodging other formations.

### Collapsing Circle
Big circle of loosely-spaced dots that appears centered(ish) on the player, then shrinks while rotating and moving slowly

play impact: must be recognized in time so player can get out between the dots. can lead to very juicy combo kills once the circle has closed.

### Aimed Arrow
#TODO add aimed arrow formation

wedge- or arrow-shaped formation

appears pointing in random direction, rotates to point toward player, maximum rotation speed

once it's pointing at the player and keeps a lock for (specific time interval) it shoots off toward the player, pretty fast

play impact: must watch the whole screen and pay attention to timing

### Shearing Walls
#TODO add shearing walls formation

walls with gaps that appear on opposite edges of the screen and sweep across it. each wall's dots fit into the other wall's gaps: when they overlap, there is no safe space
