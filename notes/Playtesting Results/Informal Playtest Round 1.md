## Feedback
### Snuggle Squiggle
overall:
> oh this is cool
> mouse control is really nice for this sort of game
> (later) i am now playing solo's game instead of working on my own
> when this gets more powerups and attack patterns i might be addicted tbh

performance:
> game doesn't run well on web.



powerup spawning:
> i may just be salty but
> can i suggest a 'fireballs slightly prefer not to spawn near other fireballs' mechanic

formations:
> (+1 for the attack patterns though.  the circles are cool and more bullet hell stuff would be great)
> the + signs feel like money ballons tbh
> mm delicious points

pausing:
> i paused to see if i could line up a screenshot
> then i clicked resume to unpause and my lil dude immediately zips from the side of the screen the middle where the resume button is
> prolly make it so that you can right click to unpause

scoring/gameplay:
> dunno if this fits into your design, but thoughts on making the point score slowly tick up so that pure survival has a benefit?
> as i play more i notice i pretty much go for pure style/points maxing, and figure i would play more conservatively/try to survive if surviving long was recognized
> or actually, just have a clock on top in addition to the dots-killed tracker would probably be enough
> ~~alternatively, this turns it into a resource management survival game, where the resource you're managing is your framerate by keeping the number of dogs down~~

### foxels' Bedlam
> a set of scripted dot-spawns and trajectories to happen at \[scheduled/semirandom/random?\] times
> more than basic circle


NB: hadn't seen cross formation

### zenAndroid
> well
> it aint good for my blood pressure
> ill tell ya that much
> it occurs to me that i may be bad at this type of game

### Zoru
overall:
> ayy that is a fun little game

> (suggests object pooling to deal with performance issues)

need to investigate whether perf issues come from instance/free in the first place
