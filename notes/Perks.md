Player picks a small number (three?) of perks from among a moderate lineup (twenty?) before game start.

perks allow player to adjust to specific playstyle, for example:
- I like explosions -> take explosion related perks (more explosion powerups, they're better somehow, etc)
- I love dodging and weaving -> take powerups that make this easier, e.g. (improved) slowing field
